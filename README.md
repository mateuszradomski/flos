# flos

A hand-rolled, zero-dependency, multi-threaded C solidity formatter breaking GB/s of throughput.

- Raw performance: uses a parallel pipeline that splits file discovery, tokenizing, parsing, and printing across all your available CPU cores. It will saturate your I/O and CPU, and it will not apologize
- Hand-Rolled with Zero-Dep: No package manager. No dependency hell. Everything is from scratchâ€”the multi-threaded work queue, the memory arenas, the parser, the pretty-printer. Just a C compiler and pthreads. That's it.
- Intelligent Pretty-Printing: This isn't a naive line-by-line indenter. _flos_ builds a full Abstract Syntax Tree and uses a proper document-based rendering algorithm (based on Wadler algorithm) to intelligently break lines and group elements. The output is beautiful and consistent
- It Won't Break Your Build: Tested on a mountain of real-world code to ensure it's not just fast, but unbreakable. Your code's syntax is sacred.

## Rough benchmarks

Expect better benchmarks in the future, but to deliver on the GB/s promise, here it is:
